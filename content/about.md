A brief interview of myself, by myself...

### Who are you?

I'm Conrad, an SMU grad living and working in New Orleans at [Lucid](https://luc.id/) as an Engineer.

### Why did you create this blog?

Well, the _main_ reason is to document my learning while stumbling through my [Engaged Learning][el] [project]. However, I don't see a reason why I couldn't use it to document my other projects along my journey.
